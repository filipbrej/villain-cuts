                        Dedication to the clients and their need of hairstyles
                        fit for them should be the one goal for every haircut
                        given. Too many times, people get haircuts that the
                        STYLIST wants to give, not what the CLIENT wants to get.

                        Starting my hair cutting career at University of
                        Illinois Urbana-Champaign in my dormâ€™s courtyard, I
                        worked my way up to having over 70 clients coming in
                        monthly by the end of my college tenure.

                        This was all made possible because I had a desire to
                        give college students like myself the oppportunity to
                        look fresh for an affordable price. Your trust is my
